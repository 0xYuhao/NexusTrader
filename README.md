TradeBotPro is a flexible and powerful trading bot framework designed to interact with various cryptocurrency exchanges. It provides a robust architecture for managing exchange connections, order placements, and real-time data streaming via WebSockets.

## Features

- Support for multiple cryptocurrency exchanges (currently implemented: Binance, Bybit, OKX)
- Asynchronous operations using `asyncio`
- WebSocket support for real-time data streaming
- Order management (limit orders, market orders)
- Account management
- Extensible architecture for easy addition of new exchanges

## Why We Are Faster Than Other Bots

- We utilize [uvloop](https://github.com/MagicStack/uvloop) to enhance the event loop's performance, achieving speeds that are 2-4 times faster than the default event loop.
- We employ [picows](https://github.com/tarasko/picows), a Cython-based WebSocket framework, which can match the performance of C++'s Boost.Beast. Other Python frameworks, such as `websockets` and `aiohttp`, are comparatively slower.
- We leverage `msgspec` for data serialization and deserialization, which outperforms alternatives like `orjson`, `ujson`, and `json`. All data classes are defined as `msgspec.Struct`, which is more efficient than traditional `dataclass`.
- All orders are managed using `asyncio.Queue`.
- The core components (MessageBus, Clock, etc.) are implemented in Rust, with the Python code generated by the [nautilius](https://github.com/nautilius/nautilius) framework.

## Multi-Mode Support

TradeBotPro supports multiple modes of operation to cater to different trading strategies and requirements. Each mode allows for flexibility in how trading logic is executed based on market conditions or specific triggers.

### Event-Driven Mode

In this mode, trading logic is executed in response to real-time market events. The methods `on_bookl1`, `on_trade`, and `on_kline` are triggered whenever relevant data is updated, allowing for immediate reaction to market changes.

```python
class Demo(Strategy):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.subscribe_bookl1(symbols=["BTCUSDT-PERP.BINANCE"])
    
    def on_bookl1(self, bookl1: BookL1):
        # implement the trading logic Here
        pass
```

### Timer Mode

This mode allows you to schedule trading logic to run at specific intervals. You can use the `schedule` method to define when your trading algorithm should execute, making it suitable for strategies that require periodic checks or actions.

```python
class Demo2(Strategy):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.schedule(self.algo, trigger="interval", seconds=1)
    
    def algo(self):
        # run every 1 second
        # implement the trading logic Here
        pass
```

### Custom Signal Mode

In this mode, trading logic is executed based on custom signals. You can define your own signals and use the `on_custom_signal` method to trigger trading actions when these signals are received. This is particularly useful for integrating with external systems or custom event sources.

```python
class Demo3(Strategy):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.signal = True
    
    def on_custom_signal(self, signal: object):
        # implement the trading logic Here,
        # signal can be any object, it is up to you to define the signal
        pass
```

## Quick Start

Here's a basic example of how to use TradeBotPro:

```python
import asyncio
from tradebot.exchange import BinanceExchangeManager, BinanceOrderManager
from tradebot.constants import KEYS

async def main():
    config = {
        'exchange_id': 'binance',
        'sandbox': True,
        'apiKey': KEYS['binance_future_testnet']['API_KEY'],
        'secret': KEYS['binance_future_testnet']['SECRET'],
        'enableRateLimit': False,
    }
    
    exchange = BinanceExchangeManager(config)
    await exchange.load_markets()
    order_manager = BinanceOrderManager(exchange)
    
    res = await order_manager.place_limit_order(
        symbol='BTC/USDT:USDT',
        side='buy',
        price=59695,
        amount=0.01,
        positionSide='LONG',
    )
    
    print(res)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

## Core Components

### ExchangeManager

The `ExchangeManager` class handles the initialization and management of exchange connections. It's responsible for loading markets and providing a unified interface for interacting with different exchanges.

### OrderManager

The `OrderManager` class manages order-related operations such as placing and canceling orders. It provides methods for creating limit and market orders, as well as canceling existing orders.

### WebsocketManager

The `WebsocketManager` class handles WebSocket connections for real-time data streaming. It provides methods for subscribing to various data streams such as order book updates, trades, and user data.

## Supported Exchanges

TradeBotPro currently supports the following exchanges:

1. Binance
2. Bybit
3. OKX

Each exchange has its own implementation of the core components, allowing for exchange-specific features and optimizations.

## Advanced Usage

### Subscribing to WebSocket Streams

Here's an example of how to subscribe to a WebSocket stream:

```python
import asyncio
from tradebot.exchange import BinanceWebsocketManager
from tradebot.constants import Url

async def callback(msg):
    print(msg)

async def main():
    ws_manager = BinanceWebsocketManager(Url.Binance.Spot)
    await ws_manager.subscribe_kline("BTCUSDT", interval='1s', callback=callback)
    
    while True:
        await asyncio.sleep(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

### Error Handling

TradeBotPro provides custom exceptions for better error handling. For example, the `OrderResponseError` is raised when there's an issue with an order operation:

```python
from tradebot.exceptions import OrderResponseError

try:
    res = await order_manager.place_limit_order(...)
except OrderResponseError as e:
    print(f"Error placing order: {e}")
```
